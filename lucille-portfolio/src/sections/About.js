        <p>I'm a front-end web developer 
        and designer based in Vancouver. 
        I pride myself in constructing clean 
        and precise code, as well as possessing 
        an innovative mind. I love seeing a 
        creative vision come to life and am 
        passionate about creating and 
        collaborating with others to design 
        the perfect digital experience.</p>
        <p>When I'm away from my computer, 
        I enjoy spending time at the gym or 
        socializing with friends. I have always 
        loved to push myself out of my comfort 
        zone which has impacted my life in a 
        positive way. I have travelled through 
        many countries across the world, which 
        has helped me broaden my perspective 
        and deepen my appreciation for life!
